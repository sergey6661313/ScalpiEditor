# ScalpiEditor - console text editor for linux writed from zig language.
  ⚠️ display only ansi symbols
  ⚠️ no undo/redo
  ⚠️ does not offer to save the file on exit (until it stabilizes)
  
  
# motivation:
  This text editor was created for quick navigation through the sources 
  It allows code blocks to be treated like folders.
    

# download and compile: 
## DOWNLOAD

### and find binary in "zig-out/bin"...
# usage:

## you may rename and copy binary to "~/bin/se" like this:

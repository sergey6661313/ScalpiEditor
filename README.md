ScalpiEditor - Simple console text editor writed from zig language.
  ⚠️ display only ansi symbols
  ⚠️ no undo/redo
  ⚠️ does not offer to save the file on exit (until it stabilizes)
  
motivation:
  This text editor was created for quick navigation through the sources. 
  It allows code blocks to be treated like folders.  
    
compile: 
  for compile use zig language ver. 0.9. (https://ziglang.org):
  $ zig build
  and find binaries in "zig-out/bin"...
